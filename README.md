# Overview

1. The `Expression.eval_expr(...)` adds `var: int` which can be set as 1 or 2, indicating the number of variables.
For a single variable experssion, the var is by default set to 1.
If you want two variables, then: `Expression.eval_expr(... , var = 2)`

2. The graphing system now has converged to only one function: `Graphing.plot(...)` for better usage.
Herein, centered, static and speed are set to False, False and 50 respectively.
For two var expressions, z is also required but by default is set to `None`.

## Purpose

When I was in school, it was hard to visulise graphs for many of the students. And when we did plot them, it was only for 2 or 5 points.
This was made in nostalgia such that one can actually see what is happenning!
